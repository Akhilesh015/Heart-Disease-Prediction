# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Used various classification algorithms to predict heart disease in a patient.

Dataset Description:-

1.age: The person's age in years

2.sex: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)

3.cp: The chest pain experienced (Value 1: typical angina, Value 2: atypical angina, Value 3: non-anginal pain, Value 4: asymptomatic)

4.trestbps: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

5.chol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl

6.fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)

7.restecg: Resting electrocardiographic measurement (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria)

8.thalach: The person's maximum heart rate achieved

9.exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

10.oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more here)

11.slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 1: upsloping, Value 2: flat, Value 3: downsloping)

12.ca: The number of major vessels (0-3)

13.thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect)

14.target: Heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)


Heart disease risk factors to the following: high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, weight, family history and smoking .

According to another source , the major factors that can't be changed are: increasing age, male gender and heredity.

Note that thalassemia, one of the variables in this dataset, is heredity.

Major factors that can be modified are: Smoking, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, physical inactivity, and being overweight and having diabetes.

Other factors include stress, alcohol and poor diet/nutrition.
